# Optimized-Frequent-Items-Algorithms
Project for COMP-4250

This repository contains the optimized algorithms for both Apriori and PCY. Before you run, make sure all libraries are installed using **pip**.

## Apriori
- Running the results using **results2.csv**
- For optimized Apriori, run the following commands:
```bash
cd apriori
```
```bash
python3 apriori-optimized.py
```

## PCY
- Running the result using dataset
- For optimized PCY, run the following commands:
```bash
cd PCY
```
```bash
python3 pcyC.py dataset.csv 100
```
